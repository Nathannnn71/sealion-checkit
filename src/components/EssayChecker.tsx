The right to vote is linked to many other significant rights and principles, such of that of equality and justice. It should not be denied to eligible citizens, including those who have infringed on the rights of others.

Prisoners should be allowed the right to vote, as this right is crucial to our classification as a democracy. The primary argument denying prisoners this right is based on a gross generalization, and denies their standing as citizens of the state.

The right to vote defines our nation as a democracy and should be afforded to all citizens. The denial of this right for prisoners in general, denies their citizenship, even to those felons who are incarcerated because of minor crimes or crimes that have inviolable wrong action by society as a whole to society themselves but not because it is a punishment against the right to vote that may concern on the might to equal justice. We should deny only the rights that in our objective justice system is necessary to ensure a just and functional democracy. If we restrict a citizen the right to vote he or her voice heard should be them to any other, what other infringements can we justify?

The primary argument against allowing prisoners the right to vote, which often infringes on the right of another, his or her own rights, is based on a gross generalization. This argument fails to take into account the significant number of prisoners who are incarcerated because of minor crimes or crimes that stem civil moral prohibitions, wrong action to feed but not because it is a punishment against the tenets of moral and just government. You would argue that a mansions insolently achieve the violence toward social patterns.`);
